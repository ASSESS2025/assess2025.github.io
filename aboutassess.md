**How can cities become spaces of symbiotic coexistence between humans and nature?**
**How can we measure, assess, and visualize the dynamic interplay between natural and anthropogenic systems?**
**What innovative techniques and tools can support cities as socio-ecological systems (SES), fostering sustainable urban development in a rapidly urbanizing world?**

As urban areas expand and climate conditions fluctuate, cities face significant challenges in balancing human needs with environmental resilience.

ASSESS focuses on advancing spatial modeling and assessment of socio-ecological systems, with a particular emphasis on the role of green-blue infrastructures, and ecosystem and landscape services within urban environments.

The aim is to bring together researchers to present and discuss cutting-edge techniques, methodologies, and digital tools that enhance our understanding of cities as interconnected socio-ecological systems.

Therefore, ASSESS invites contributions showcasing data-driven approaches with applications in - among others:
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
- Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSSs), and
- Machine Learning,

to provide insights that can inform sustainable urban planning and policy-making.
Key topics may include, for example, **urban modeling**, **spatial data science**, **spatial econometrics**, and other methodologies that evaluate the spatial impacts of urban growth on socio-ecological functions and assess the role of ecosystem services in enhancing urban resilience.

We encourage submissions that explore diverse approaches and tools that can deepen our understanding of Human-Nature Connectedness in urban environments and support cities on their journey towards sustainability and resilience.
