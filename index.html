    <h1>Welcome to ASSESS2025</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>How can cities become spaces of symbiotic coexistence between humans and nature?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How can we measure, assess, and visualize the dynamic interplay between natural and anthropogenic systems?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What innovative techniques and tools can support cities as socio-ecological systems, fostering sustainable urban development in a rapidly urbanizing world?</strong>
      </p>
      As urban areas expand and climate conditions fluctuate, cities face significant challenges in balancing human needs with environmental resilience.
      
      This workshop focuses on advancing spatial modeling and assessment of socio-ecological systems, with a particular emphasis on the role of green and blue infrastructures,
      and ecosystem and landscape services within urban environments.
      
      The aim is to bring together researchers to present and discuss cutting-edge techniques, methodologies, and digital tools that enhance our understanding of cities as interconnected SES.
      Therefore, ASSESS invites contributions showcasing data-driven approaches with applications in - among others - Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA),
      Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSSs), and Machine Learning, to provide insights able to inform sustainable urban planning and policy-making.
      Key topics may include, for example, urban modeling, spatial data science, spatial econometrics,
      and other methodologies that evaluate the spatial impacts of urban growth on socio-ecological functions and assess the role of ecosystem services in enhancing urban resilience.
      We encourage submissions that explore diverse approaches and tools that can deepen our understanding of Human-Nature Connectedness in urban environments and support cities on their journey towards sustainability and resilience.
